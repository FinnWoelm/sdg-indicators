ONS is responsible for the development and collection of UK data for the [Sustainable Development Goals](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) (SDG) global indicators and for reporting UK progress towards them. This website is for disseminating UK SDG indicator data. It is currently at an Alpha stage, and so is still under development.

The site is based on the open source '[Open SDG](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)' platform. The Open SDG platform is the result of collaboaration between the US government, the UK [Office For National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/) (ONS), and the nonprofit [Center For Open Data Enterprise](http://opendataenterprise.org/) (CODE).

Other countries wishing to reuse the Open SDG reporting platform are welcome to do so for free. The Open SDG [Quickstart guide](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start/) gives technical instructions on the quickest way to get a copy of the Open SDG platform up and running.

Our [Guidance page](https://github.com/ONSdigital/sdg-indicators/wiki/Clone-your-own%3A-step-by-step-instructions-%28Windows%29) also documents this process in more detail for first-time users.

If you have any feedback on this website or UK SDG data then please contact us at <a href="mailto:{{site.email_contacts.questions}}">{{site.email_contacts.questions}}</a>. The answers to some frequently asked questions are also available in the [FAQ]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/faq.md %}).
